# HashMap Indexing

## Features
- Insertion, lookup, and display functionalities.
- Handles collisions using chaining.
- Dynamically resizes based on load factor.
- Supports user input for Lookup and Insert


## How to Compile and Run
- Compile the code using `javac Driver.java`.
- Run the compiled class with `java Driver`.
- After prepopulating the map, you will be prompted to enter '1' for insertion, '2' for lookup, or any other key to exit.

## Limitations
- The current implementation does not support deleting elements from the hash map.
- the current implementation also does not support unique keys, meaning that duplicate keys will be stored but you will only have access for the one.
